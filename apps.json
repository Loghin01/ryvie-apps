    "description": "Node-RED is a visual programming tool for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services in new and interesting ways.\n\nIt provides a browser-based editor that makes it easy to wire together flows using the wide range of nodes in the palette that can be deployed to its runtime in a single-click. A built-in library allows you to save useful functions, templates or flows for re-use.\n\nThe flows created in Node-RED are stored using JSON which can be easily imported and exported for sharing with others. An online flow library allows you to share your best flows with the world.\n\nNote: If you would like your 'HTTP In' nodes to be accessible without authentication, then prepend your url with '/public/'.
